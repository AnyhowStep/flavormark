# Superscript

Basic emphasis

```````````````````````````````` example
*foo*
.
<p><em>foo</em></p>
````````````````````````````````

Basic superscript

```````````````````````````````` example
^foo^
.
<p><sup>foo</sup></p>
````````````````````````````````

Authors who want interpretation 3 can use backslash escapes:

```````````````````````````````` example
Foo
bar
\---
baz
.
<p>Foo
bar
---
baz</p>
````````````````````````````````

Final spaces are stripped before inline parsing, so a paragraph
that ends with two or more spaces will not end with a [hard line
break]:

```````````````````````````````` example
aaa    
bbb
.
<p>aaa<br />
bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


Backslash-escaped `#` characters do not count as part
of the closing sequence:

```````````````````````````````` example
### foo \###
## foo #\##
# foo \#
.
<h3>foo ###</h3>
<h2>foo ###</h2>
<h1>foo #</h1>
````````````````````````````````

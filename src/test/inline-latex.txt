This is a simple latex span:

```````````````````````````````` example
$foo$
.
<p><latex>foo</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


Here two backticks are used, because the latex contains a backtick.
This example also illustrates stripping of leading and trailing spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
$$ foo $ bar  $$
.
<p><latex>foo $ bar</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


This example shows the motivation for stripping leading and trailing
spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
$ $$ $
.
<p><latex>$$</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


[Line endings] are treated like spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
$$
foo
$$
.
<p><latex>foo</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


Interior spaces and [line endings] are collapsed into
single spaces, just as they would be by a browser:

```````````````````````````````` example
$foo   bar
  baz$
.
<p><latex>foo bar baz</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


Not all [Unilatex whitespace] (for instance, non-breaking space) is
collapsed, however:

```````````````````````````````` example
$a  b$
.
<p><latex>a  b</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


Q: Why not just leave the spaces, since browsers will collapse them
anyway?  A:  Because we might be targeting a non-HTML format, and we
shouldn't rely on HTML-specific rendering assumptions.

(Existing implementations differ in their treatment of internal
spaces and [line endings].  Some, including `Markdown.pl` and
`showdown`, convert an internal [line ending] into a
`<br />` tag.  But this makes things difficult for those who like to
hard-wrap their paragraphs, since a line break in the midst of a latex
span will cause an unintended line break in the output.  Others just
leave internal spaces as they are, which is fine if only HTML is being
targeted.)

```````````````````````````````` example
$foo $$ bar$
.
<p><latex>foo $$ bar</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


Note that backslash escapes do not work in latex spans. All backslashes
are treated literally:

```````````````````````````````` example
$foo\$bar$
.
<p><latex>foo\</latex>bar$</p>
````````````````````````````````


Backslash escapes are never needed, because one can always choose a
string of *n* backtick characters as delimiters, where the latex does
not contain any strings of exactly *n* backtick characters.

latex span backticks have higher precedence than any other inline
constructs except HTML tags and autolinks.  Thus, for example, this is
not parsed as emphasized text, since the second `*` is part of a latex
span:

```````````````````````````````` example
*foo$*$
.
<p>*foo<latex>*</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````


And this is not parsed as a link:

```````````````````````````````` example
[not a $link](/foo$)
.
<p>[not a <latex>link](/foo</latex>)</p>
````````````````````````````````


latex spans, HTML tags, and autolinks have the same precedence.
Thus, this is latex:

```````````````````````````````` example
$<a href="$">$
.
<p><latex>&lt;a href=&quot;</latex>&quot;&gt;$</p>
````````````````````````````````


But this is an HTML tag:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a href="$">$
.
<p><a href="$">$</p>
````````````````````````````````


And this is latex:

```````````````````````````````` example
$<http://foo.bar.$baz>$
.
<p><latex>&lt;http://foo.bar.</latex>baz&gt;$</p>
````````````````````````````````


But this is an autolink:

```````````````````````````````` example
<http://foo.bar.$baz>$
.
<p><a href="http://foo.bar.$baz">http://foo.bar.$baz</a>$</p>
````````````````````````````````


When a backtick string is not closed by a matching backtick string,
we just have literal backticks:

```````````````````````````````` example
$$$foo$$
.
<p>$$$foo$$</p>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
$foo
.
<p>$foo</p>
````````````````````````````````

The following case also illustrates the need for opening and
closing backtick strings to be equal in length:

```````````````````````````````` example
$foo$$bar$$
.
<p>$foo<latex>bar</latex></p>
````````````````````````````````

# Extended WWW Autolink
`````````````````

Basic extended www autolink

```````````````````````````````` example
www.commonmark.org
.
<p><a href="http://www.commonmark.org">www.commonmark.org</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

After a valid domain, zero or more non-space non-< characters may follow:

```````````````````````````````` example
Visit www.commonmark.org/help for more information.
.
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.commonmark.org/help">www.commonmark.org/help</a> for more information.</p>
````````````````````````````````

We then apply extended autolink path validation as follows:

Trailing punctuation (specifically, ?, !, ., ,, :, *, _, and ~) will not be considered part of the autolink, though they may be included in the interior of the link:

```````````````````````````````` example
Visit www.commonmark.org.

Visit www.commonmark.org/a.b.
.
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.commonmark.org">www.commonmark.org</a>.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.commonmark.org/a.b">www.commonmark.org/a.b</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

When an autolink ends in ), we scan the entire autolink for the total number of parentheses.
If there is a greater number of closing parentheses than opening ones, we donâ€™t consider the last
character part of the autolink, in order to facilitate including an autolink inside a parenthesis:

```````````````````````````````` example
www.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business)

(www.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business))
.
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business)">www.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business)</a></p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business)">www.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business)</a>)</p>
````````````````````````````````

This check is only done when the link ends in a closing parentheses ), so if the only parentheses are in the interior of the autolink, no special rules are applied:

```````````````````````````````` example
www.google.com/search?q=(business))+ok
.
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=(business))+ok">www.google.com/search?q=(business))+ok</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

If an autolink ends in a semicolon (;), we check to see if it appears to resemble an entity reference; if the preceding text is & followed by one or more alphanumeric characters. If so, it is excluded from the autolink:

```````````````````````````````` example
www.google.com/search?q=commonmark&hl=en

www.google.com/search?q=commonmark&hl;
.
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=commonmark&amp;hl=en">www.google.com/search?q=commonmark&amp;hl=en</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=commonmark">www.google.com/search?q=commonmark</a>&amp;hl;</p>
````````````````````````````````

< immediately ends an autolink.

```````````````````````````````` example
www.commonmark.org/he<lp
.
<p><a href="http://www.commonmark.org/he">www.commonmark.org/he</a>&lt;lp</p>
````````````````````````````````

An extended url autolink will be recognised when one of the schemes http://, https://, or ftp://, followed by a valid domain, then zero or more non-space non-< characters according to extended autolink path validation:

```````````````````````````````` example
http://commonmark.org

(Visit https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business))

Anonymous FTP is available at ftp://foo.bar.baz.
.
<p><a href="http://commonmark.org">http://commonmark.org</a></p>
<p>(Visit <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business)">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Markup+(business)</a>)</p>
<p>Anonymous FTP is available at <a href="ftp://foo.bar.baz">ftp://foo.bar.baz</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

These break CommonMark auto link rules

```````````````````````````````` example
<http://foo.bar/baz bim>

< http://foo.bar >

http://example.com
.
<p>&lt;<a href="http://foo.bar/baz">http://foo.bar/baz</a> bim&gt;</p>
<p>&lt; <a href="http://foo.bar">http://foo.bar</a> &gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a></p>

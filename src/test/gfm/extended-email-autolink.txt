# Extended Email Autolink
`````````````````

Basic extended email autolink

```````````````````````````````` example
foo@bar.baz
.
<p><a href="mailto:foo@bar.baz">foo@bar.baz</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

+ can occur before the @, but not after.

```````````````````````````````` example
hello@mail+xyz.example isn't valid, but hello+xyz@mail.example is.
.
<p>hello@mail+xyz.example isn't valid, but <a href="mailto:hello+xyz@mail.example">hello+xyz@mail.example</a> is.</p>
````````````````````````````````

., -, and _ can occur on both sides of the @, but only . may occur at the end of the email address, in which case it will not be considered part of the address:

```````````````````````````````` example
a.b-c_d@a.b

a.b-c_d@a.b.

a.b-c_d@a.b-

a.b-c_d@a.b_
.
<p><a href="mailto:a.b-c_d@a.b">a.b-c_d@a.b</a></p>
<p><a href="mailto:a.b-c_d@a.b">a.b-c_d@a.b</a>.</p>
<p>a.b-c_d@a.b-</p>
<p>a.b-c_d@a.b_</p>

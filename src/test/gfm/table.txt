# Table
`````````````````

Basic table

```````````````````````````````` example
| foo | bar |
| --- | --- |
| baz | bim |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>baz</td>
<td>bim</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

Cells in one column don’t need to match length, though it’s easier to read if they are. Likewise, use of leading and trailing pipes may be inconsistent:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | defghi |
:-: | -----------:
bar | baz
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">abc</th>
<th align="right">defghi</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">bar</td>
<td align="right">baz</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

Cells in one column don’t need to match length, though it’s easier to read if they are. Likewise, use of leading and trailing pipes may be inconsistent:

```````````````````````````````` example
| f\|oo  |
| ------ |
| b `\|` az |
| b **\|** im |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>f|oo</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>b <code>|</code> az</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b <strong>|</strong> im</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````


The table is broken at the first empty line, or beginning of another block-level structure:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| bar | baz |
> bar
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td>baz</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<blockquote>
<p>bar</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

The table is broken at the first empty line, or beginning of another block-level structure:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| bar | baz |
bar

bar
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td>baz</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td></td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>bar</p>
````````````````````````````````

The header row must match the delimiter row in the number of cells. If not, a table will not be recognized:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- |
| bar |
.
<p>| abc | def |
| --- |
| bar |</p>
````````````````````````````````

The remainder of the table’s rows may vary in the number of cells. If there are a number of cells fewer than the number of cells in the header row, empty cells are inserted. If there are greater, the excess is ignored:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| bar |
| bar | baz | boo |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td>baz</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

If there are no rows in the body, no <tbody> is generated in HTML output:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead></table>
````````````````````````````````

Tables end with a blank line

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |

Hi
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead></table>
<p>Hi</p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example

<tr>

<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead></table>

<tr>

A table in a blockquote

```````````````````````````````` example
> | abc | def |
> | --- | --- |

| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
.
<blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>

</thead></table>
</blockquote>
<table>

```````````````````````````````` example
> | abc | def |
> | --- | --- |
> | ghi | jkl |

| abc | def |
| --- | --- |

.
<blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ghi</td>

</tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

````````````````````````````````

A table in a list item

```````````````````````````````` example
- | abc | def |
  | --- | --- |
  | ghi | jkl |

| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| ghi | jkl |
.
<ul>
<li><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ghi</td>
<td>jkl</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ghi</td>
<td>jkl</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | defghi |
-:| -----------:
bar | baz
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="right">abc</th>
